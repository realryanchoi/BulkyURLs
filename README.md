A note about extensions policy
Extensions on the Chrome Web Store must adhere to the Chrome Web Store policies. Here are some things to keep in mind as you begin:

An extension must fulfill a single purpose that is narrowly defined and easy to understand. A single extension can include multiple components and a range of functionality, as long as everything contributes towards a common purpose.

User interfaces should be minimal and have intent. They can range from a simple icon, such as the AMP validator]amp-validator extension shown above, to opening a new window with a form, like the Google Similar Pages extension shown below.
